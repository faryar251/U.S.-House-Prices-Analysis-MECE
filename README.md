# U.S.-House-Prices-Analysis-MECE
This project deals with analysing all the factors that can influence the U.S. housing prices in the next decade.
The dataset was created using the individual time series found on [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).

##### Images of MECE Frameworks can be viewed [here](https://github.com/faryar251/U.S.-House-Prices-Analysis-MECE/tree/main/MECE%20Framework)

## MECE Framework is given as follows:
- First, the problem statement was broken down into a conceptual model to figure out the factors involved, where the House Prices were looked at from 3 different levels:
  - House Level concerned with only the structure of the house
  - House Level concerned with the locality of the house
  - National economy level i.e., concerned with macroeconomic factors
- After the conceptual model, segmentation of each level mentioned above took place. 

The charts were created using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).
