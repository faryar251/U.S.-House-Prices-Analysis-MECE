# MECE Framework is given as follows:
- First, the problem statement was broken down into a conceptual model to figure out the factors involved, where the House Prices were looked at from 3 different levels:
  - House Level concerned with only the structure of the house
  - House Level concerned with the locality of the house
  - National economy level i.e., concerned with macroeconomic factors
- After the conceptual model, segmentation of each level mentioned above took place. 

The chart were created using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).
